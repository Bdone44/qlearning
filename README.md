# Q learning - Intro To Reinforcement Learning

The purpose of this repo is to help you start with your reinforcement learning journey. 
Below, I divided the resources into three section so you can easily find what you are looking for. 
As a general rule, easy sections have problems that can be understood without any prior knowledge of reinforcement learning. Medium might require some additional research and advance are for individuals who are more familiar with the topic. 

Contact me if you feel that my list could use some additional links.
