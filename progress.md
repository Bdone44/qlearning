Read  this paper: 
http://webee.technion.ac.il/people/shimkin/LCS11/ch4_RL1.pdf

It is a good overview will probably read it again. Also, good explanation of equations. 
Learning Approaches: The main approaches for learning in this context can be classified as
follows:
* Indirect Learning: Estimate an explicit model of the environment (Pˆ and ˆr in our
case), and compute an optimal policy for the estimated model (“Certainty Equivalence”).
* Direct Learning: The optimal control policy is learned without first learning an explicit
model. Such schemes include:

  a. Search in policy space: Genetic Algorithms, Policy Gradient....


  b. Value-function based learning, related to Dynamic Programming principles: Temporal
Difference (TD) learning, Q-learning, etc.

### 20180107
This is the start. 
* Set up everything 
* Read a number of articles to refresh my knowledge

TODO: 
* Need to work on my roadmap, milestones and rewards.
